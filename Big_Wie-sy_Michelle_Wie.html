  What Michelle Wie is achieving in the world of golf is tremendous and something to behold. She is an inspiration not only to girls in golf, but any person who dreams big dreams. This person is striving to achieve what has never been done before, and she is going after tremendously lofty goals at the age of 15. The sky is truly the limit when it comes to her talents and potential, and it is an inspiration to watch. <br>
  <br>
  Everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is my opinion that the comments to the contrary by a few of Ms. Wie's competitors and the media related to having this phenom play &quot;only in women's events&quot; are completely short-sighted, and in some cases, wholly ignorant. The interest she brings to the game of golf across a variety of groups is something very unique and something that can help in growing the game. Suzy Whaley, Annika Sorenstam and Michele Wie are all to be applauded and encouraged for striving make a cut in a men's professional event in our era, as Babe Didrikson-Zaharias was able to accomplish three times in 1945. Beyond this, these performances are inspirational outside the realm of golf. While the awareness and interest in professional golf tournaments has increased with the superstardom of Tiger Woods, the game has been stagnating in terms of number of players and number of golf rounds played per year. This girl's achievements, and likewise the achievements of Annika Sorenstam, and Suzy Whaley are to be applauded and appreciated by those who truly have the best interests of the game in mind and want to see the game of golf grow. <br>
  <br>
  Related to those who have commented Ms. Wie &quot;does not belong in men's events&quot;, I am reminded of the sage words of Hale Irwin speaking to the contestants at the 1992 United States Jr. Amateur. Billy Andrade was scheduled to speak to us contestants in the clubhouse at Wollaston Golf Club in Milton, MA that evening, but had phoned the USGA to report he was going to be late to the event. Hale Irwin's son was in the field of qualifiers for the USGA Jr. event which included Tiger Woods, and was asked to say a few words to the contestants. His message was short, but very memorable. He said, &quot;As players, you have achieved something by getting to this point. No doubt many of you have been and will be successful in other golf events. But never forget this: the game doesn't owe you anything. Rather, you owe this game something.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  I will always remember these words of wisdom. It is with this mindset and love of the game of golf that we present our website, our contest, and photographs related to major tournament golf to you.  Those of us that work to provide the images and format simply love the game. <br>
  <br>
  Though Ms. Wie's quest this week for a Masters berth has ended, no doubt she has progressed further on the way towards her goals. We wish her the best and are rooting for her to be a potential selection at Augusta on EyeOnMajors.com someday.<br>
