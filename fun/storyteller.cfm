			By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of <u>____</u>; 
			and upon the stream there stood a mill. The <u>____</u>'s house was close by, and the 
			<u>____</u>, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very 
			<u>____</u> and <u>____</u>; and the <u>____</u> was so proud 
			of her, that he one day told the king of the land that his daughter could spin <u>____</u> 
			out of <u>____</u>. Now this king was very fond of <u>____</u>; and when he heard 
			the <u>____</u>'s boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be 
			brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great 
			heap of <u>____</u>, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, 'All this must be spun 
			into <u>____</u> before morning, as you love your life.' It was in vain that the poor 
			maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing 
			as spin <u>____</u> into <u>____</u>: the chamber door was locked, and she was 
			left alone.
