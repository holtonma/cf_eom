              <br />
        Those of us who have founded the site, and created this format, have done so for one reason -- because we love and honor the great game of golf. We hope that this format brings you, your families, your friends, your office mates and acquaintances as much enjoyment during the weeks that we host tournaments as we have hosting them.<br />
        <br />
        You can be sure that we will work tirelessly to continue to improve the website&rsquo;s features and ease of use because this is our passion. We welcome your feedback at anytime. <br />
        <br />
        As an example, we have recently utilized the services of a professional photographer, Mike &lsquo;Sandbagger&rsquo; Inguagiato, who travels the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, and other professional golf tours capturing never before seen images of these finely tuned athletes in action. Look for other unique insights and tools in the future as well, as we take you &lsquo;INSIDE THE ROPES&rsquo; at the major championships<a href="/store/global_leaderboard_present_m05.cfm">!</a><br />
        <br />
        Unlike other pool and fantasy golf sites, EyeOnMajors.com will never rent, sell, or otherwise distribute your email address to any third party. Your email address as logged with EyeOnMajors.com will be used to present you solely with information about the championship you are competing in, and offers that you opt-in to hearing about. We provide this site for the enjoyment of our patrons. At the same time, we will work hard in the coming years to provide prizes to our champions that are relevant and have value, while providing options for value for those of you who have yet to become a champion<a href="/British_2005_preview.htm">.</a><br />
        <br />
        Sincerely and respectfully,<br />
        The EyeOnMajors.com Committee<br />
        <br />
        The EyeOnMajors.com Committee consists of founding members Mark Holton and Jerry Eye. In rules matters, we will work hard to reach a decision that is understood by all pool entrants. The decision of the committee is final.</p></td>
