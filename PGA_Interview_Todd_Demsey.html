        <p class="white style29">Mark Holton: &quot;Todd is currently preparing for the Nationwide Tour event this week in Nebraska --- first of all, thanks a lot, Todd, for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us for an interview and provide some information for our patrons. I can speak for all of the patrons on eyeonmajors.com in saying we really appreciate it&quot;<br>

        <p class="white style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29">MH: &quot;You've had some solid weeks recently on the Nationwide Tour with a tie for 15th finish in the Canadian PGA Championship a couple weeks ago. Having played in many big time events over your years in golf as an amateur and a professional, it seems you play your best in big events, like, for instance your victory in the NCAA Individual Championship, or your 3-0 Walker Cup record ...can you tell us a little about what it feels like as a tournament golfer, professional golfer approaching a top event like a major? And what, if anything, you do differently to prepare for these events?&quot;</p>
        <p class="mastersgreen">Demsey's insights:: <a href="/mDemsey_q2a.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> Part 1 :: (38 secs) -- <a href="/demsey4.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> Part 2 :: (58 secs) <a href="/mDemsey_q2b.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> Part 3 :: (24 secs) <a href="/mDemsey_q2c.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> Part 4 :: (16 secs)</p>
        <p class="style29"><br>
        MH: &quot;At a major championship course like Baltusrol, which is no doubt has some length at 7200 yards, par 70, along with some fast greens and long rough... what kind of game do you think it will take to will play well here?&quot;</p>
        <p class="style29"><span class="mastersgreen"><a href="/mDemsey_q3.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> Demsey's answer (41 secs)</span></p>
        <p class="style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29">MH: &quot;You've played against most of the players in this PGA Championship field at one time or another throughout your career..... if you were picking say, the  guys off the top of your head to contend, including one or two sleepers, who would they be?&quot;</p>
        <p class="style29"><span class="white style29"><a href="/mDemsey_q5.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> <span class="mastersgreen">Demsey's answer (35 secs)</span></span></p>
        <p class="style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29">MH: &quot;Recently, players like Mark Hensby have come off the Nationwide Tour and had very solid success on the PGA Tour with victories in the Western Open last year, and just this past week a victory in Sweden. Besides Tiger, Hensby is having one of the best years out of anyone in the majors. Give us your take on Mark Hensby and his chances. &quot;</p>

        <p class="style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29">MH: &quot;Having played with Hensby a good amount, can you relay some of what strikes you about his game that has taken him to the next level in the last couple years since graduating from the Nationwide Tour &quot;</p>
        <p class="style29"><span class="white style29"><a href="/mDemsey_q7.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> <span class="mastersgreen">Demsey's answer (28 secs) </span><a href="/mDemsey_q8.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> <span class="mastersgreen">Demsey's answer (13 secs) </span></span></p>
        <p class="style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29"> MH: "any other guys off the Nationwide Tour in the field off the top of your head that you think might contend this week? And how about your former college teammate at Arizona State, Phil Mickelson?" </p>
        <p class="style29"><span class="white style29"><a href="/mDemsey_q9.mp3"><img src="/images/mic.gif" width="26" height="35" border="0"></a> <span class="mastersgreen">Demsey's answer (39 secs) </span></span></p>
        <p class="style29">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style29">MH: &quot;Ok, now we're going to put you on the spot.... given Tiger is an 8 shot handicap, and Vijay is a 5 shot handicap in our game here on eyeonmajors.com... and there is a 2 shot handicap for your college teammate Phil Mickelson along with Retief Goosen....... who would your 6 selections be for the PGA Championship and why-&quot;</p>
